<p>For the past two years the Wellcome Library  has been engaged in a programme to improve access to its collections by digitising a large amount of content drawn from the Library’s collection of archives, books, films and art works and making this content freely available online.</p>

<p>The Player can be seen in action here:</p>

<p><a href="http://wellcomelibrary.org/player/b18024130">http://wellcomelibrary.org/player/b18024130</a></p>

<p>It is a tool for displaying objects in a digital library. It has many things in common with the Internet Archive BookReader, but it's not just about books - although it's good at them. It's a container for playing any kind of digital content that might be found in a library, via plugins and extensions. The Player on the Wellcome Library site shows artworks, audio, video as well as archives, journals, manuscripts and books.</p>

<p>Some features of the player:</p>

<ul>
<li>Structural information for books, allowing security model to be applied</li>
<li>Deep Zoom for images (openseadragon)</li>
<li>"Search within" and term highlighting</li>
